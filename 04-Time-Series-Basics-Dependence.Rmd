# Time Series Basics-Dependence

We would like to understand the relationship among all random variables in a time series. In order to do that, we would need to look at the joint distribution function.  

Suppose the time series consists of the random variables  . The cumulative joint distribution function for these random variables is: 

$$ F(c_1, c_2, â€¦, c_n) = P(X_1\leq{c_1},X_2\leq{c_2},...,X_n\leq{c_n}) $$
 
This can be VERY difficult to examine over the MULTIDIMENSIONS. 

The one-dimensional cumulative distributional function is denoted by $ F_t(x) = P(X_t \leq{x} ) $for a random variable $X_t$ at time t. The corresponding probability distribution function is $f_t(x)=\frac{\partial{F_t(x)}}{\partial{x}}$
